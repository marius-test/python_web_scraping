# python_web_scraping

**Web scraping** demonstration in **Python**

**Libraries** used: *beautifulsoup4, lxml, requests, time*

This repository contains two example scripts:

- Parsing static HTML files with BeautifulSoup to extract course names and prices  
- Scraping live QA engineer job listings from Jooble, filtering by recent posts, and saving results as text files  

The job scraper runs continuously with a 24-hour delay between scrapes.
